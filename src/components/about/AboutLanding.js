                    <h1>Since 1985.</h1>
                    <p>CMR Entertainment was created in 1985. Our DJs played in night clubs, private parties and local radio stations. Back then, we didn't have a website and our business was strictly by word of mouth, repeat customers and referrals with no advertising, except for a business card here and there. There also weren't many options or add on sevices available to our customers. Today, however, we have a website, still have business cards and our business still comes mostly from repeat customers and referrals. We have also added many services and add-ons.</p>
